    "description": "After completing my Diploma in Computer Science, I began working as a Graphic Designer.\n\n  However, I soon realized that what I really wanted to do was work as Software Engineer, so I started learning from online seminars. During my studies, I learned to code HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ionic, Angular — all of which were essential to my eventual success as a Web Application Developer.\n  \n  Since then, I have been able to further expand my skills on my own and have learned React, React Native, Express, Redux, Mobx State Management, all in efforts to becoming a better Developer.\n  \n  My top priority is exceeding my biggest expectations and focusing on growing to be a Software Engineer.",

            "description": "Sitting around with friends watching football and arguing about who knows more about football is fun, but it can be difficult to keep track of whose team is winning, who's winning the trivia and by how much. There are plenty of apps out there that tell you the scores, but what if you want a prediction app that tells you which team will be in the lead at any time? In response to this need, our client came to us with a great idea: make an all-in-one app combining scores, statistics and trivia that allows users to predict who will be in the lead at any given time.",
